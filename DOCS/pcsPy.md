pcsPy is a module for pitch class set classification and manipulation in any
arbitrary temperament; the construction of generalized pitch class set networks
using distances between common descriptors (interval vectors, voice leadings);
the analysis of scores and the generation of compositional frameworks.

ThePCSetclass. pcsPyis is comprised of thePCSetclass and its methods (listed
below) and a series of functions for pcs network manipulations. ThePCSetclass
deals with the classification and manipulation of pitch set classes generalized
to arbitrary temperament systems (arbitrary number of pitches). The following
methods are available:

- `def init (self,pcs,TET=12,UNI=True,ORD=True)`
    - pcs (int) pitch class set as list or numpy array
    - TET (int)number of allowed pitches in the totality of the musical space
       (temperament). Default = 12 tones equal temperament
    - UNI (logical) if True, eliminate duplicate pitches (default)
    - ORD (logical) if True, sorts the pcs in ascending order (default)
- `def normalOrder(self)` -
    Order the pcs according to the most compact ascending scale in pitch-class
    space that spans less than an octave by cycling permutations.
- `def normal0Order(self)` -
    As normal order, transposed so that the first pitch is 0
- `def transpose(self,t=0)` -
    Transposition by t (int) units (modulo TET)
- `def zeroOrder(self)` -
    transposed so that the first pitch is 0
- `def inverse(self)` -
    inverse operation: (-pcs modulo TET)
- `def primeForm(self)` -
    most compact normal 0 order between pcs and its inverse
- `def intervalVector(self)` -
    total interval content of the pcs
- `def LISVector(self)` -
    Linear Interval Sequence Vector: sequence of intervals in an ordered pcs
- `def operator(self,name)` -
    operate on the pcs with a distance operator
    - name (str) name of the operator O(ni)

    Name of pcs according to the Forte classification scheme (only for TET=12)

    Name of pcs as chord in a jazz chart (only for TET=12 and cardinalities 7)
- `def commonName(self)` -
    Display common name of pcs (music21 function - only for TET=12)
- `def commonNamePrime(self)` -
    As above, for prime forms
- `def nameWithPitchOrd(self)` -
    Name of chord with first pitch of pcs in normal order
- `def nameWithPitch(self)` -
    Name of chord with first pitch of pcs
- `def displayNotes(self,xml=False,prime=False)` -
    Display pcs in score in musicxml format. If prime is True, display the prime
    form.
   - xml (logical) write notes on file in musicxml format
   - prime (logical) write pcs in prime form

Network functions. pcsPycontains specific functions for network generation and
analysis. Network functions include:

- `def pcsDictionary(Nc,order=0,TET=12,row=False,a=np.array(None))` -
    Generate the dictionary of all possible pcs of a given cardinality in a gen-
    eralized musical space of TET pitches. Returns the dictionary as pandas
    DataFrame and the list of all Z-related pcs
   - Nc (int) cardinality
   - order (logical) if 0 returns pcs in prime form, if 1 retrns pcs in
      normal order, if 2, returns pcs in normal 0 order
   - row (logical) if True build dictionary from tone row, if False, build
      dictionary from all combinatorial pcs of Nc cardinality given the totality
      of TET.
   - a (int) if row = True, a is the list of pitches in the tone row
- `def pcsNetwork(inputcsv, thup=1.5, thdw=0.0,TET=12, distance=
    ’euclidean’, col=2,prob=1)` -
    generate the network of pcs based on distances between interval vectors.
    In output it writes the nodes.csv and edges.csv as separate files in csv format
   - inputcsv (str) file containing the dictionary generated by pcsNet-
      work
   - thup, thdw (float) upper and lower thresholds for edge creation
   - distance (str) choice of norm in the musical space, default is ’eu-
      clidean’
   - col (int)metric based on interval vector, col = 1 can be used for voice
      leading networks in spaces of fixed cardinality NOT RECOMMENDED
   - prob (float)if not 1, defines the probability of acceptance of any given
      edge
- `pcsEgoNetwork(label,inputcsv,thupe=5.0,thdwe=0.1,thup=1.5,thdw=0.1,
    TET=12,distance=’euclidean’)` -
    Generates the network for a focal node (ego) and the nodes to whom ego is di-
    rectly connected to (alters). In output it writes the nodesego.csv, edgesego.csv
    and edgesalters.csv as separate files in csv format
   - label (str) label of the ego node
   - thupe, thdwe (float) upper and lower thresholds for edge creation
      from ego node
   - thup, thdw (float) upper and lower thresholds for edge creation
      among alters
   - distance (str) choice of norm in the musical space, default is ’eu-
        clidean’
- `def vLeadNetwork(inputcsv,thup=1.5,thdw=0.1,TET=12,w=True,
distance=’euclidean’,prob=1)` -
Generation of the network of all minimal voice leadings in a generalized
musical space of TET pitches based on the minimal distance operators select
by distance. In output returns nodes and edges tables as pandas DataFrames.

sical space of TET pitches based on the minimal distance operators select
